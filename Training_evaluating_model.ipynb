    "## Task 2: Train a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating a machine learning (ML) model starts with data processing. After the data processing is complete, you choose an ML algorithm to train your model. The goal of model training is to create a model that you can use to make predictions with future data. Your processed data must contain a target, but your future data does not contain a target (it is unlabeled). The algorithm finds patterns in the training data that map the input data attributes to the target. The algorithm then outputs an ML model that captures these patterns. When you have a model, you can make predictions on new data that does not contain the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to train an ML model to predict if an email is spam or not spam, you would provide your model with training data that contains emails where you know the target (in this case, a label that tells whether an email is spam or not). Using this data, the algorithm creates a model that predicts if an email is spam or not spam. You can use this model to predict future email labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you are predicting if someone has less than 50,000 USD or not. Your model is training to optimize itself so that it can predict if someone has less than 50,000 USD as accurately as possible. Model training requires some configuration, including which kind of algorithm you want to use to train. In this task, you use the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm. When you train a model, you also need to configure your hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are parameters that control the training job process. They can be adjusted to change various steps in the training job. Selecting the right set of hyperparameters is important in terms of model performance and accuracy. After you train the model, you evaluate the model and view the model artifacts."

    "An estimator is a high level interface for SageMaker training. You create an estimator object by supplying the required parameters, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, compute instance count and type, and the Amazon S3 output path. This lab uses the XGBoost built-in algorithm for the SageMaker generic estimator. XGBoost is a popular and efficient open-source implementation of the gradient boosted trees algorithm. Gradient boosting is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to accurately predict a target variable by combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler and weaker models. The XGBoost algorithm performs well in handling a variety of data types, relationships, distributions, and the variety of hyperparameters that you can fine-tune. You can use XGBoost for regression, classification (binary and multiclass), and ranking problems. In this case, you are using XGBoost to solve a classification problem (whether someone is making less than 50,000 USD or not).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **image_uri**: The training container image URI. In this example, the SageMaker XGBoost training container URI is specified using *image_uris.retrieve*.\n",
    "- **role**: The IAM role that SageMaker uses to perform tasks on your behalf (for example, reading training results, calling model artifacts from Amazon S3, and writing training results to Amazon S3). \n",
    "- **instance_count and instance_type**: The type and number of Amazon EC2 ML compute instances to use for model training. For this lab, you use a single ml.m5.xlarge instance, which has 4 CPUs, 16 GB of memory, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage, and a high network performance.\n",
    "- **output_path**: The path to the S3 bucket where SageMaker stores the model artifact and training results.\n",
    "- **sagemaker_session**: The session object that manages interactions with SageMaker API operations and other AWS service that the training job uses.\n",
    "- **rules**: A list of Amazon SageMaker Debugger built-in rules. In this example, the create_xgboost_report() rule creates an XGBoost report that provides insights into the training progress and results."
