    "# Exploring Transformers: Tokenization, Self-Attention, and Text Generation with BERT and GPT-2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Transformers have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). They have set new standards for language understanding, text generation, and other NLP tasks. This section explores three key concepts related to Transformers: **tokenization**, **self-attention**, and **text generation**. We will specifically focus on how these concepts are implemented and applied using two widely-used transformer models: **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and **GPT-2** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Tokenization\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of splitting a sentence or text into smaller units (tokens). These tokens can be words, sub-words, or characters, and they serve as the basic units that models process to understand and generate language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **BERT Tokenization**\n",
    "- **BERT** uses a **WordPiece tokenizer**, which breaks words into subword units based on frequency and usage in the training data.\n",
    "- For example, a word like \"unhappiness\" may be split into \"un\", \"happiness\" or even smaller units if the word isn't frequent enough in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **GPT-2 Tokenization**\n",
    "- **GPT-2** uses a **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** tokenizer, which splits words into subword tokens based on the most frequent pairs of characters in the training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both BERT and GPT-2 use tokenizers to transform raw text into numerical representations that can be processed by the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Self-Attention Mechanism\n",
    "The **self-attention mechanism** is at the core of the Transformer model. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, regardless of their position, and attend to them accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **BERT's Self-Attention**\n",
    "- **BERT** uses a **bidirectional self-attention** mechanism. This means that it considers the context from both directions (left and right) when processing a word.\n",
    "- The attention mechanism enables BERT to understand the relationship between words that are far apart in the sentence. For instance, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat,\" BERT can understand the relationship between \"cat\" and \"mat\" even though they are separated by other words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **GPT-2's Self-Attention**\n",
    "- **GPT-2**, on the other hand, uses **unidirectional self-attention**. It processes text from left to right and generates predictions word by word. It doesn't have access to future tokens during the generation phase, meaning it only attends to the words that come before the current token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention allows these models to focus on different parts of the sentence depending on the task, which is a major improvement over previous models like RNNs and LSTMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Text Generation with BERT and GPT-2\n",
    "### **BERT's Role in Text Generation**\n",
    "- **BERT** is primarily used for **understanding language**, not generating it. However, it can be fine-tuned for tasks like **text completion** and **question answering**.\n",
    "- In some applications, BERT can be paired with another generative model like GPT for better performance in text generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **GPT-2's Role in Text Generation**\n",
    "- **GPT-2**, unlike BERT, is designed for **text generation**. It is a causal language model that generates text based on a given prompt.\n",
    "- GPT-2 generates coherent and contextually relevant text by predicting the next word in a sequence based on previous words.\n",
    "- **Example**: Given the prompt \"Star Trek\", GPT-2 might generate multiple continuations like \"Star Trek is a science fiction series,\" or \"Star Trek explores the universe.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Generating Text with GPT-2**\n",
    "- GPT-2 is known for its ability to generate human-like text by predicting the next word based on the preceding context. It can produce text for a wide range of applications, from writing articles to completing sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Transformers, with their self-attention mechanism, have significantly improved the performance of NLP models. **BERT** is an excellent model for tasks that require understanding context in a bidirectional manner, while **GPT-2** excels in generating coherent text in a unidirectional fashion. Together, these models can be used for a variety of NLP tasks, from tokenization and understanding relationships between words to generating creative and contextually relevant text.\n"

    "- **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: This is a plotting library that is typically used for creating visualizations such as graphs and charts. In this case, it’s imported but not used directly in the provided code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Defining the `encodePositions` Function\n",
    "- The function **`encodePositions(num_tokens, depth, n=10000)`** generates **sinusoidal positional encodings** for a sequence of tokens, which are used in transformer-based models (like BERT, GPT) to help the model understand the relative position of each token in the input sequence.\n",
    "  - **`num_tokens`**: The number of tokens (or positions) in the sequence.\n",
    "  - **`depth`**: The size of the positional encoding vector for each token.\n",
    "  - **`n=10000`**: A constant that affects the frequency of the encoding, controlling the scale of the sine and cosine waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`positionalMatrix = np.zeros((num_tokens, depth))`**: Initializes a matrix of zeros with dimensions `(num_tokens, depth)` to store the positional encodings for each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Populating the Positional Encoding Matrix\n",
    "- **Outer loop (`for row in range(num_tokens)`)**: Iterates over each token in the sequence to compute its positional encoding.\n",
    "- **Inner loop (`for col in np.arange(int(depth/2))`)**: Iterates over half of the **depth** because each token has two values for its positional encoding (one from the sine function and one from the cosine function).\n",
    "- **`denominator = np.power(n, 2*col/depth)`**: This computes the denominator used in the sine and cosine functions, which adjusts the frequency of the encoding. The formula ensures that the encoding’s wavelength is dependent on the token position and depth.\n",
    "- **`positionalMatrix[row, 2*col] = np.sin(row/denominator)`**: Applies the **sine** function to the token’s position and stores the result in the **even-indexed** columns of the matrix.\n",
    "- **`positionalMatrix[row, 2*col+1] = np.cos(row/denominator)`**: Applies the **cosine** function to the token’s position and stores the result in the **odd-indexed** columns of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Returning the Positional Matrix\n",
    "- **`return positionalMatrix`**: The function returns the **positionalMatrix**, which contains the sinusoidal positional encodings for each token in the sequence. Each row represents a token’s positional encoding, and each column corresponds to a component of the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Summary\n",
    "This function, **`encodePositions`**, generates sinusoidal positional encodings for each token in a sequence. These encodings allow transformer models to understand the relative position of tokens within the input sequence. The positional encoding is computed using **sine and cosine functions** of varying frequencies, which provides a unique representation of each token’s position. The resulting matrix can be used by models like BERT and GPT to process input sequences effectively.\n"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we learned the following key concepts and techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**:\n",
    "   - We explored how **BERT** and **GPT-2** handle tokenization differently using their respective tokenizers (**WordPiece** for BERT and **BPE** for GPT-2).\n",
    "   - We learned how raw text is broken down into smaller units (tokens) that the model can process, and the importance of tokenization in enabling models to understand text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Attention Mechanism**:\n",
    "   - We studied the **self-attention mechanism** that is central to the Transformer architecture. \n",
    "   - We compared **BERT's bidirectional attention** and **GPT-2's unidirectional attention**, and understood how these mechanisms allow models to capture relationships between words in a sentence, regardless of their position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Text Generation**:\n",
    "   - We learned how **GPT-2** generates text based on a given prompt, producing coherent, human-like text.\n",
    "   - We also discussed **BERT's role in understanding text** and how it can be fine-tuned for tasks like **question answering** and **text completion**, but it is not designed for generating text like GPT-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, we gained hands-on experience in working with tokenization, self-attention, and text generation, providing a solid foundation for further exploration of transformer models like **BERT** and **GPT-2**.\n"
