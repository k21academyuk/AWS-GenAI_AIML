One of your tasks is to generate personalized and empathetic responses to customers who have expressed dissatisfaction, aiming to address their concerns and improve customer satisfaction. Using a large language model (LLM), you need to automate the process of drafting responses based on their sentiment from previous communications."

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Importing Libraries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **json**: This library is used to handle **JSON data**, such as parsing or creating JSON files.\n",
    "- **os**: This module helps interact with the **operating system**, for tasks like accessing file paths or environment variables.\n",
    "- **sys**: Used for modifying **system paths**, allowing the script to access modules from different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Boto3 and Botocore:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **boto3**: This is the **AWS SDK for Python**, which allows you to interact with **AWS services** like Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "- **botocore**: This library handles the **low-level interaction** with AWS services, managing tasks such as making requests and receiving responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Modifying System Path:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code adds the **parent directory** (`\"..\"`) to the **system path**, enabling the script to access files or modules from that directory.\n",
    "- **`sys.path.append()`** ensures that Python can find and import the necessary files from the parent folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Connecting to Amazon Bedrock:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`boto3.client()`**: This creates a **connection** to Amazon Bedrock using the service name `'bedrock-runtime'`.\n",
    "- **`region_name`** is fetched from the environment variable **`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`**, which defines the region to connect to (e.g., `us-east-1`). If not set, it defaults to `None`.\n",
    "- This step **establishes communication** with the Amazon Bedrock service, allowing you to interact with its **AI models** for tasks like **text generation** or other language-related tasks.\n"

    "\n",
    "This section of the code prepares the **data** to send to the AI model for generating text. The data is formatted in **JSON** format and contains the prompt and configuration settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`inputText`**:\n",
    "   - This is the **prompt** that we created earlier (the request to generate an email). It contains the task for the AI model to perform — in this case, writing an email in response to customer feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`textGenerationConfig`**:\n",
    "   - This defines the **settings** for how the AI should generate the text. It includes the following parameters:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`maxTokenCount`**: This sets the maximum length of the generated text, in terms of tokens. A **token** can be a word or part of a word, so setting it to **8192** allows the model to generate a reasonably long response.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`stopSequences`**: This defines any specific **stop points** where the AI should halt generating text. In this case, it's left as an empty list (`[]`), meaning the AI will not stop until it reaches the **end of the prompt** or maximum token count.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`temperature`**: This controls the **randomness** of the generated response. A value of `0` means the response will be **predictable** and **deterministic** (i.e., the model will choose the most likely next token). Higher values like `0.7` would make the response more **random**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **`topP`**: This parameter controls how **varied** the model's response can be. A value of `0.9` means the model will consider the top **90% of probable next tokens** for generating the response. This helps the model produce more natural and creative outputs while avoiding overly repetitive or irrelevant text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "The code creates a structured **request** to send to the AI model. The `inputText` provides the instructions for the task (writing the email), while the `textGenerationConfig` ensures that the model generates the response with the desired length, creativity, and predictability. This setup helps guide the AI model in generating the response according to specific requirements.\n"

    "\n",
    "This code interacts with **Amazon Bedrock** to generate text from an AI model, using the **boto3 client** to send requests and handle responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting Model ID and Request Headers**:\n",
    "   - **`modelId`**: Specifies the version of the AI model to use (in this case, `'amazon.nova-lite-v1:0'`).\n",
    "   - **`accept`**: Defines the format of the expected response, which is **JSON**.\n",
    "   - **`contentType`**: Specifies that the request body will be in **JSON** format.\n",
    "   - **`outputText`**: Initializes an empty string that will later store the generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invoking the AI Model**:\n",
    "   - **`bedrock_client.invoke_model()`** sends the request to the **Amazon Bedrock service** using the specified model ID and the provided data (`body`).\n",
    "   - The response is expected in **JSON** format, as specified by the **`accept`** and **`contentType`** headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reading and Parsing the Response**:\n",
    "   - The response from the AI model is received in **JSON** format and is parsed using **`json.loads()`** to convert the response into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extracting the Generated Text**:\n",
    "   - The **`outputText`** is extracted from the response, which is stored under the **`results`** key. The generated text is retrieved from the first result (`[0]`), specifically from the **`outputText`** field.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling Errors**:\n",
    "   - If an error occurs (such as access being denied), the **`except`** block catches the error.\n",
    "   - If the error is an **AccessDeniedException**, troubleshooting resources are printed to the console to help resolve the issue.\n",
    "   - If it’s another type of error, the error is re-raised to be handled elsewhere or logged.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code interacts with **Amazon Bedrock** using the **response stream** to process and print the model's output in **chunks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize an Empty List**:\n",
    "   - **`output = []`**: Initializes an empty list to store the chunks of the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invoking the Model with Response Stream**:\n",
    "   - The **`invoke_model_with_response_stream()`** method sends the **request** to the AI model and retrieves the **response stream**.\n",
    "   - The **`body`**, **`modelId`**, **`accept`**, and **`contentType`** are passed to specify the request details.\n",
    "   - **`stream = response.get('body')`** gets the body of the response, which is a stream of data chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Processing the Stream**:\n",
    "   - **`i = 1`**: A counter to keep track of the chunks as they are processed.\n",
    "   - The `for` loop iterates over the **response stream**, and each **chunk** of data is extracted and processed one by one.\n",
    "   - **`chunk = event.get('chunk')`** retrieves the chunk from the event in the stream.\n",
    "   - **`json.loads(chunk.get('bytes').decode())`** decodes the chunk from **bytes** to a JSON object.\n",
    "   - **`text = chunk_obj['outputText']`** extracts the **generated text** (email) from the JSON object.\n",
    "   - **`output.append(text)`** stores the generated text in the `output` list.\n",
    "   - **`print(f'\\t\\t\\x1b[31m**Chunk {i}**\\x1b[0m\\n{text}\\n')`** prints the current chunk, with the chunk number (`i`) highlighted in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - The **`try`** block ensures the process runs, and the **`except`** block handles any **AWS access errors**.\n",
    "   - If an **AccessDeniedException** occurs, an error message with troubleshooting links is displayed.\n",
    "   - Any other errors are re-raised for further handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This code allows **real-time processing of the AI model’s output** in **chunks**, printing each chunk of the generated text as it is received. It helps handle larger outputs efficiently and provides clear feedback for debugging or error handling.\n"
